# Event Handle Button

## Project Description
I embarked on this project with the aim of honing my skills in event handling and leveraging the powerful React developer tools. The resulting app is a simple yet effective implementation, featuring fields for first name, last name, and email. Upon completion of each field, the message displayed at the top of the screen is dynamically updated with the relevant information.

I was able to complete the project without encountering any notable challenges. Nonetheless, the opportunity to solidify and refine my existing skill set was highly beneficial and greatly appreciated.

At this time, I have no plans to make any future updates or modifications to this project, as I consider it to be complete.

## Hooks vs Classes

The major difference between Hooks and class-based state is that hooks are used inside of the functional component. One thing to keep in mind is that never call hooks inside of any logic, it should always be on the top level!

## React Hooks

- Used in functional components in React
- Does not require the declaraction of any kind of constructor
- there is no need of using this keyword in state declaration or modification
- Easier to use because of the useState() functionality

## Classes

- Used in class based components in React
- Declaration of constructor has to be made inside of the class component
- this keyword is used in state declaraction i.e. this.state and in modification this.setState()
- No specify function that helps us access the state and its corresponding setState variable
